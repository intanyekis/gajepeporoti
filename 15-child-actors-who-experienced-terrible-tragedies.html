Other kids don’t have it as easy, because no one has control over who their parents are, or where they are born – it really is like winning (or losing) the lottery. The hardships kids face while figuring out how to be functioning adults are often called “growing pains” because they hurt so much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For celebrity kids, tweens, and teens, these bumps and bends in the road can seem harder, mostly because they’re in the public all the time, and the paparazzi may be recording some of the worst moments of their lives before they’re old enough to cope. The life of a celebrity often seems blessed, but some pretty horrific things can happen behind closed doors. Some children make it through their strained and difficult childhoods stronger, learning from their hardships, whereas others continue to struggle into their adult lives because they can’t get over the tragedies they have faced– this is no different for kids who are actors.</p><p>Sometimes these stories hit the news, other times celebrities have become famous despite their difficult pasts, sharing their stories long after they’ve broken into the industry. These are 15 child actors that experienced terrible personal tragedies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-gary-coleman-suffered-with-kidney-disease><strong>15. Gary Coleman Suffered With Kidney Disease</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Gary Coleman</a> rose to fame and became a household name when he was just 10 years old and starring on the hit show Diff’rent Strokes in 1978. For nearly a decade Coleman portrayed the loveable younger adoptive son of a wealthy man named Philip Drummond. He quickly became known for his small stature and witty catch phrase “Whatcha talkin’ ‘bout Willis?” with fans loving him. Unfortunately one of the things that helped bring Coleman fame, his childlike height, was caused by a congenital autoimmune kidney condition. The star was constantly in and out of the hospital both before and after he found success as a child star. He required daily dialysis and was the recipient of two kidney transplants in his life. In addition to his health worries, the star also had many financial issues thanks to his adoptive parents not managing his earnings properly. Gary Coleman died when he was just 42 years old following a fall in his home which led to a brain hemorrhage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-shia-labeouf-s-father-suffered-from-ptsd-and-held-a-gun-to-his-head><strong>14. Shia LaBeouf's Father Suffered From PTSD And Held A Gun To His Head</strong></h2><p>Shia LaBeouf may have money today, but that wasn’t always the case. His childhood was spent with his heroin addicted and abusive father, a Vietnam Veteran who had PTSD. The star’s young life comprised of a lot of time tagging along with his dad who was attending AA meetings, so it really isn’t surprising that <a href=#>Shia</a> himself has also struggled with his own demons. One time his father, during a flashback to the war, held a gun to Shia’s head. After his parents divorced, things weren’t any easier for his single mother to make ends meet. It was then that Shia decided to become an actor, and help his poverty stricken family. Even though they had their problems over the years, Shia remains close and supportive to both of his parents using his fortune to help support them both.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-joaquin-phoenix-saw-his-big-brother-die><strong>13. Joaquin Phoenix Saw His Big Brother Die&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Everything seemed to be going so well for the Phoenix family in the late 1980s and early 1990s. River was getting critical acclaim for his roles in hits including Stand by Me, My Own Private Idaho, and he had been cast as a young Indiana Jones in the popular series.

Joaquin managed to cope and go on to become a successful award winning actor, despite the loss of his older brother. Unfortunately this death will continue to haunt him.

Rose McGowan Was Part Of A Cult As A Child</strong></h2><p>The early years of actor <a href=#>Rose McGowan</a>’s life were everything but Charmed. She spent the first nine years of her life in the borders of a controversial cult group known as Children of God. The group combined hippie based attitudes of free-love alongside preparations for the second coming of Jesus Christ. She lived in this commune alongside her parents, and even as a child remembers being upset about the way women were treated there. She says, “I remember watching how the cult's men were with the women, and at a very early age I decided I did not want to be like those women. They were basically there to serve the men sexually.” She recalls women going to bars to “pick up” new recruits which was referred to as “flirty fishing”. She and her family left the cult when it began to encourage sex between adults and children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-brandy-killed-a-woman-with-her-car-and-injured-two-kids><strong>11.

She was riding high when her collaborative hit “The Boy is Mine” with singer Monica won a Grammy in 1998. Everything seemed to be perfect for the young starlet as she entered adulthood and more mature projects, until tragedy struck. On December 30, 2006 she was driving home when she was involved in a fatal car accident where two children were injured, and their mother was killed. Shattered by the incident the star was investigated for manslaughter, although there wasn’t enough evidence to lay the charges. Years later Brandy told Oprah of the dark time period in her life, “I don’t think that’s something I could ever get over or ever truly understand, but that was one of the worst times in my life.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-leighton-meester-s-mother-was-in-prison-and-pregnant-with-her><strong>10.

In 1983 Leighton’s mother was imprisoned for helping smuggle a 1,200 pound shipment of marijuana out of Jamaica as a part of a plan that also included Meester’s father and aunt. After their arrest, Leighton’s aunt broke out of prison and holds the dubious honour of being the first woman to make the U.S. Marshal's 15 Most Wanted List. Since her mother was pregnant with Leighton when she was arrested, she was permitted to go to a hospital for her daughter’s birth, however still had to serve the 16 months in prison following Leighton’s birth.

This was&nbsp;long before she was the RomCom sweetheart and petite Hollywood giant we know her as today. Unfortunately, behind the scenes of the films she spent her childhood trying to numb her pain through drink and drugs. Her grandfather, despite being a successful legendary screen director, had a drinking problem and died of cirrhosis of the liver at the young age of 60. His son, Drew’s Dad, was also named John and had a severe alcohol problem like his dad, abandoned Drew and her mom when Drew was still a baby. He spent most of his life in and out of jail on drug related charges, and died of cancer just a few years ago. Her mother would take eight-year-old Drew to Hollywood parties where Drew got hooked on alcohol and drugs herself. In her book Little Girl Lost she wrote about her struggles to fit in, find order in her chaotic Hollywood life all while growing up and getting clean.

At the time the actor asked a judge to allow for her 35-year-old sister Shanelle Gray to take over her custody in place of her own mother who was emotionally and physically abusive. In the court documents Winter accused her mother of slapping, hitting, and pushing her. There were other rumours of Chrystal Gray depriving her daughter of food and being highly involved with the star’s figure and diet. Her mom has since denied these accusations, insisting they stem from Ariel wanting to date an older boy that she disapproved of.

Jenna’s mom mismanaged her daughter’s money, and Jenna accused her ma of misusing one million dollars of her earnings. Her mother reportedly threatened to move her daughter to Las Vegas (which would make working in Hollywood harder for the star) if she were to go through with firing her, and file her request for emancipation.

When interviewed by The Hollywood Reporter Feldman disclosed that he was repeatedly molested by adult men in the industry and that many others knew this was happening and did nothing to stop it. Feldman has qualified about one of the abusers, “This person uses intimidation and threats as a way to keep people quiet. And all these men were all friends”. In addition to these atrocities Feldman was granted emancipation from his abusive and neglectful mother at 15, when he was also able to control his own finances.

Working as a chef, he decided a bank robbery would be a good way to get the family back in the black, unfortunately he wasn’t a very good robber. He robbed the bank directly across the street from his home, in the middle of the day, without a mask. Neighbours identified him running across the street with the money he’d stolen and called the police. Since it was a first offence, and he didn’t have a weapon so he only served two years. He’s said to have learned his lesson and has been on team 'good guy' ever since.

The young star grew up alongside a cruel stage mother who wanted her daughter to be perfect and lashed out at her when things didn’t meet her high expectations. Melissa wrote a book about her childhood, Diary of a Stage Mother’s Daughter to help create awareness of the impact parents have on their children, particularly Tiger Moms. Melissa has said of her experiences, with her emotionally abusive mom, “I realized at that moment that [my mother] was really insane. But that same type of response [from my mother] affected my sister [differently] and [made her feel] she was [not] worthy and it destroyed her. She carried that [emotional burden] and disapproval with her everywhere she went.
